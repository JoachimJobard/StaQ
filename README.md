StaQ is a finite-memory approach to Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) for discrete action spaces. It retains the last $M$ Q-functions in a stacked neural network, giving an optimization-free policy update that retains PMD's error-averaging effect. In the paper, increasing $M$ improves performance up to a point where finite-memory StaQ closely matches exact PMD.

## Setup

Create a Python 3.10 Conda environment and install the project dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n staq python=3.10
conda activate staq
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Experiments

The `run/` directory contains the configurations used for the paper. Each command below takes an environment and seed. For example:

```bash
# Classic control
run/staq_classic.sh CartPole-v1 12345

# MinAtar
run/staq_minatar.sh MinAtar/Asterix-v1 12345
```

These paper scripts run for 5M timesteps. The StaQ memory size $M$ is controlled by `--memory-size` and defaults to $M=300$. The environments benchmarked in the paper are:

```
CartPole-v1
Acrobot-v1
LunarLander-v2
MountainCar-v0

MinAtar/Asterix-v1
MinAtar/Breakout-v1
MinAtar/Freeway-v1
MinAtar/Seaquest-v1
MinAtar/SpaceInvaders-v1
```
